# 👋 Hello, I'm Normand!

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  I’m a tech enthusiast who’s in a committed relationship with my code editor. Making myself suffer by diving into a Leetcode grind. 

Always down to learn something new, explore uncharted digital territories, and maybe even find a bug that doesn’t require me to question my life choices.

## 🌟 About Me
I'm a full-stack developer with a deep interest in NextJS and Laravel. Whether it's optimizing a codebase, developing new features, or experimenting with emerging tech, I'm constantly driven by a curiosity for **what’s possible**.

- 💼 Currently working on: A Tuition Registration Web Application
- 🛠️ Languages and Tools: NextJS & Supabase

## 🎧 Fun Fact


When I'm not coding, you can probably find me behind the decks as a DJ! Music is my creative outlet, and I love blending beats. 🎶

## 🌱 Currently Learning
I’m always expanding my knowledge, and right now, I'm diving into:

- C# ASP.NET - Currently dabbling more into developement with C# as it is still a widely used language / framework, especially where I am based at.

## 🤝 Let's Connect
I enjoy collaborating with like-minded individuals and sharing ideas. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss.
